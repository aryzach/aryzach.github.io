- was a bullshitter until end of college. I don't want to work with bullshitters (there are exceptions)
- look at email to myself about values
- litmus test (if in tech): do you know what a dyson sphere is, and what do you think of it? If they don't know, nbd (because I've forgotten the name of it), explain the concept to them, but then their reaction is important. Ie, does this intruige them?
