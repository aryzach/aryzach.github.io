ai art is just bad art. The artists it will replace are just producing mediocre art anyway. Maybe they're technically talented, but but all that means is they can produce art that is technically challenging, not that its good art

And here "good" means it pushes ideas / culture forward. Internet / digital memes are the most important visual art of the era. When was the last time a painting had material cultural impact (my art history is wack, but maybe >100 years ago?)

Generative art will replace (with current iteration of the AI tech) corporate, stock photo artists. We only call these people "artists" because we lack a better word, but they're no more artists than many other jobs. Maybe "visual PR / branding / marketing" are better terms. They can draw, but dont produce "good" art at their job (or maybe they do, but only because they're pushing ideas of corporate art forward to give the world a novel corporate art experience)



book covers
generative art machine as the important piece of art, and even showing in how it shows in this discourse



2D visual painting / drawing as the main medium we define as art is restrictive and missing the point of art. My history is wack, but maybe we think of it this way because visual art had big cultural impact.
