title: SWE methodologies from somebody who knows nothing

I'm learning about different development methodologies. In my experience writing software, I haven't had much exposure to this. I've worked on small teams at university, but my professional work has been either solo or two person teams, and it's been largely informal / unintentional. I want to learn about #bestpractices, but when researching, I've found that #bestpractices is a myth, and that there are lots of different schools of thought. 

In my next project (link here), one of my goals is to be more intentional about my practices, even though it's a solo project. Here I'll briefly hash out what I've learned about different methodologies, how my current practices relate, and what I'd like to practice with my next project.

So far: 
 - university team
 - farm software / hardware
 - farm overall / Daniel led
 - CustomDFS

### What I'll do

TDD (maybe too ambitious for this projects as it's not my main learning goal, and has a high expected time to learn / setup)
Only function-level comments (not in-function comments)
Self-commenting code
Git commit often (no set rule, but after every function and major milestone)
