### Goals
- develop a better conceptual understanding of relativity
- develop a better understanding of the math behind relativity
- be able to confidently unify my conceptual understanding and the math behind it to create a workable understanding enough to be able to apply it qualitatively and quantitatively 

### Background
- I've had a better conceptual understanding of relativity in the past
- I have fairly good conceptual and applicable understanding of electromag. Would need to consult text for some of the math, and why some of the derivative ideas are how they are
- I don't think I really grokked Maxwell's equations at the time

### What I know now
- from the perspective of light, I think time stands still

### History of the idea of relativity
- the idea of 'Ether' was **IN**. I don't totally understand this, but the idea was that light always travelled at a constant rate relative to the Ether. This was in contrast to the Newtonian idea that something moving through the Etherand emitting light, that the light would move add a speed of `speed of object + speed of light`
- It had been established that visible light and electromagnetic radiation where one the same and followed the same laws
- Maxwell's equations, and people understood the idea of a moving magnetic field induced a current (ie, a magnet moving relative to the Ether)
- (Soon prior to the next point, Einstein questioned Maxwell's light-as-a-wave idea, saying that it seems so sometimes act more like a spring, or energy storage and release device)
- (This might have been Einstein) But if the conductor (current-carrying object) moved with the magnetic field, no current is induced 
- Einstein noted this contradicts the idea that a magnetic field moving relative to the Ether induces a curre
