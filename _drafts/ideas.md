Journey to ZIO
        I knew some FP from haskell
        [Most of this book](https://books.underscore.io/essential-scala/essential-scala.html#getting-started)
        Build sloppy, unfinished hangman to get used to language
        [Followed this](https://scalac.io/blog/introduction-to-programming-with-zio-functional-effects/)
        without deep understanding just to understand the structure and though process
        redo this and try to build it myself. Basically building muscle memory
        Create other games with this lib
        More like an ecosystem than a tooling library

RC boat follow swimmer
        current option is just small buoy
        GPS vs vision
        lidar not good option
        GPS w bluetooth
        computer vision. Probably not need much data bc it's a fairly static scene. Main issues would be light and waves. Would lidar be better for this? Or camera? Fun way to learn computer vision, also possibly applicable to self driving boat to recognize swimmers

robot to paint lines in parking lot
				initial product to just to large lots w lots of repetition. Easiest problem to solve bc repetative
				is RTK GPS enough here?
				what are the other problems? do the paint tubes get clogged often or something? 

idea: slip cover for kindle to signal what book you're reading. Could be paired w/ kindle purchase and sent to you for an extra dollar or two. Some people like to keep books on shelves as either decor or as little trophies, this could replace that.

Make math video with Manim on why taurus is the shape of pacmans world, and not a sphere

Organization to pair programmers with carpal tunnel / hand / wrist / eye problems with junior programmers. Pair program where junior drives. Learning + productive + harm reducing

Post on my current understanding of circuits:
Power
	- ac
	- dc
	- uses and reasons for each (generation, storage, delivery, requirements of different circuits)
Signal
	- active
		- timer
		- hysterisis
		- e-stop
	- passive
	- cababilities of each with use case examples, or spec examples (ex. what can you do with "this" type of circuit? well you can make a time graph of voltage like "this" or time graph of current like "this")

Business idea:
Businesses that self-insure for health insurance for their employees. This means the company directly covers cost without a third-party insurance provider. In the book 'Price We Pay', there's an example where an employer who self-insures, gives incentive to employees for choosing the cheaper hospital options (but not less quality). The example was that delivering a baby costs $8000 - $40000 depending on hospital. If you chose $8000, then employer provides you a year worth of free diapers. This could be it's own business, where you do the reseawrch and setup the right incentives for employees.

hot take on mental health / therapists: I think there's a big supply gap for lesser-credentialed mental health professionals in the $30 - $70 / hour range. People could go through a one year masters program, and be "good enough". Lots of people could use / want a therapist, but it's just so expensive that it's inaccessible. I think it's the way it is because the barrier is high. So the cost is high because the therapist went through a lot of work to get there (so can demand high rates), and because it takes a lot of work to become a therapist, this keeps supply low, also adding to high cost. So much of therapy is somebody just actively listening and "caring." Maybe only 5% of the time is the actual theripist training mattering in what they say. While I think that 5% is what makes a high paid therapist super valuable, I still think that you could get a less good therapist for 25% of the cost that provides 50% - 90% of the value that a high paid therapist provides. Ideally, everybody who wants one has an excellent therapist. Say only 20% of people who want a therapist get one, but they get an excellent one. If this solution would allow the other 80% of people to get a therapist who is even 25% as good as a top therapist, we improve the therapist situation by 20%. 

What I wish I knew when learning CS / programming:
Main areas: Domain (businness thing, science thing, but also often computer thing or protocol like how browswer works), engineering process for software (prototype, testing, writing code so people can read it, clean, find bugs easily), how a computer works generally (what happens when program runs (loaded to memory), what is file system), mathy-CS bits

People systems I've hacked:
- community college in Chicago, wanted bus pass perks ($100 / month) and wanted to take calculus, but expensive and didn't need the credits. Took 1 credit music that I wanted to take anyway, got bus pass and card access to building and just audited calculus and took advantage of free tutors and office hours (professors were nice). Paid about $300 for $1000 value
- Gym in Austin, told them I was thinking about grad school, and was super nice. They put my locker in the very nice profesor locker room with bigger locker, cleaner, less people. 
- Caf in Austin, bulk up, do homework, takeout salad for dinner, all for $10 / day
- MSU caf, they'd swipe your meal card to take off a credit. 9/10 times it wouldn't go through right away and the worker would give you back the card before they got the card-denied error. If you walked away with some brisk before that error, they generally wouldn't care enough to ask you to reswipe

Addition / response to this: https://aella.substack.com/p/side-effects-of-preferred-pronouns
- I've had this same feeling but not as lucid / didn't put it into words
- think it's brilliant
- my caveat: lots of things like this are imperfect solutions to solve a problem and that's ok / just a transition period that might not be at equillibreum for 1 - 3 generations. Like maybe we all have to agree to "fake it" for our life times, but our kids generation will think it's much more normal, in part due to use tolerating the imperfect transition and 'faking it'. Maybe it's just what's necessary right now, so that in 100 years we get to a point where they look back on the article and say 'faking what? ohh people thought gender meant born sex' or whatever, I don't know the right language to be precise

How I'd like to try to become even more teachable in the right settings and even more agreeable in some settings
- this isn't really a blog post though, just a thought

On what to work on:
- ideally a tractable technical problem
- this could be solving a new problem with current tech
- solving a new problem with current tech and what is enabled by new tech
- working on a tractable tech breakthrough that will enable a lot more problems to be solved 
- the assisted death isn't technical, but think it's an important improvement on our social fabric and better functioning society, which could lead to greater impact
- however, innovating and building in tech is a multiplier, so has a lot of qualitative advantage over a non-tech pursuit. But I see a successful model for an assisted dying success. I like tech more than legal, social (from a scratch-an-itch point of view), and has those qualitive benefits, but who knows if I would find some tractable tech insight, orif I'd just end up working for somebody (also not terrible)


Deep dive math / language / linguistics post:
- do a deep dive research post on math and language / linguistics
- study on linguistic group that couldn't understand some math, but maybe they could create math that we couldn't understand
- whats the history and current state of this research? find ou
