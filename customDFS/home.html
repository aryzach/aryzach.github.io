      <h3>Projections and analysis from simulated games</h3>
      <h4>At CustomDFS.com we take a different approach to building projections:</h4>

      <ul>
          <li>
              <h3>Step 1: Set Up Basic Simulation Model </h3>
              <p>We take traditional research and analytics (individual stat projections, match-up information, projected player usage, etc) but instead of calculating projections directly we feed them into a sophisticated game simulator.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Step 2: Customize Key Stat Categories to Build Unique Simulation Model</h3>
              <p>By giving you the freedom to modify projections in key stat categories, you can give each game simulation your own unique "flavor".</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Step 3: Simulate Thousands of Games </h3>
              <p>To account for as many game outcomes as possible we simulate each game  THOUSANDS of times based on the custom simulation model that was built based on your inputs. For each simulation we record game results, team stats, and player stats.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Step 4: Analyze Data to Develop Projections and Player Interaction Data</h3>
              <p>We apply advanced analytical techniques to convert the raw simulation data into useful projections and analysis:</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Real Ceiling/Floor Analysis</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Real Player Interactions</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <img src="images/bellcurve.png" alt="bellcurve graphic" class="bellcurve">
          </li>
          <li>
              <img src="images/footballstats.png" alt="footballstats graphic" class="footballstats">
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since we base our projections on simulated games, we can provide REAL estimates of each player's ceiling and floor by finding their best and worst performances from among thousands of game simulations.</p>
      <p>Since CustomDFS projections are based on realistic game simulations, ALL players in a given game are affected even if you only modify stat projections for a single player!</p>

      <h2>Why do I need my own custom projections? There are plenty of other websites that have projections available...</h2>
      <p>The problem with using stock projections from big DFS research sites is that EVERYBODY ELSE has access to the same information.</p>

      <p>The name of the game is to not only pick the best lineup - it's to pick the best lineup that nobody else has!</p> 

      <p>With multiple sites offereing very similar projections, research, and tools -  and thousands of members on every site - you could be sharing the same data with literally THOUSANDS of other people!</p>

      <p>Unless you are building lineups based on projections that nobody else has access to, you will constantly struggle to get an advantage.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h2>OK, having my own unique projections is important - but can't I just build my own projection model?</h2>
              <p>Absolutely! All you have to do is spend hours data mining or developing advanced web scraping techniques to get a good enough data set to start to build your projection model. Then once you have the data all you need to do is spend hours and hours applying advanced analytical techniques to convert the raw data into useful projections. Then once you have your model built all you need to do is spend hours and hours and hours backtesting and verifying the model for accuracy. Then....</p>

              <p>OK I think you get my point - sure, building your own projection model is possible but who has the time to build and maintain a complex projection model? And at the end of the day all of the big sites are already doing this anyway with more time, and resources than you have available so you might as well just use their projections anyway - and now we're back to sharing our data with everybody else...</p>

              <h2>So I need my own custom projections but I probably don't have the time or resources to build them on my own - how can CustomDFS.com help me?</h2>
              <p>At CustomDFS.com we take a different approach to developing projections. By giving you the freedom to manipulate key stat categories for individual players, we can build a simulation model that is tailored to your unique insights.:</p>
              <p>NBA:  Minutes Played, Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Turnovers</p>
              <p>NFL:  Pass Attempts, Completions, Targets, Receptions, Rush Attempts, Yards (Passing/Rushing/Receiving), TDs (Passing/Rush/Receiving)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h2>Sounds interesting, but how does it work?</h2>
              <p>Step 1: You modify key stat categories based on your knowledge and insight about individual players.</p>
              <p>Step 2: We take your predictions along with baseline stat projections and Vegas information (odds/lines/over-under) to build your own unique simulation model for each game in the slate.</p>
              <p>Step 3: We run thousands of simulations for each game in the slate and record player and team statistics for every game simulation.</p>
              <p>Step 4: We convert the simulation results to a customized set of player projections along with realistic ceiling/floor information.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h2>Why are CustomDFS projections based on a simulation - can't you just build them from past performance?</h2>
              <p>There are two BIG problems with building a projection model based only on historical data:</p>
              <p>1. Most modeling techniques for player projections are based on some kind of calculation of average historical performance with some measure of variance or standard deviation to calculate floor and ceiling estimates. Unfortunately this really doesn't accurately model what possible results a player could have in a game to give a true projection, floor, and ceiling estimate. By using a simulation we are able to understand the true distribution of all possible player outcomes to give accurate projection, ceiling, and floor estimates.</p>
              <p>2. Most modeling techniques build projections for each player independently and do not account for correlation between players. By running a simulation the interactions between players are REAL so we can do correlation anlaysis, stack analysis, and lineup upside analysis.</p>
