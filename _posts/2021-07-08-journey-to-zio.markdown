I have a job lined up working in Scala and will make heavy use of ZIO. This is a brief and working post about how I'm getting there.

********************************************************************************

#### So far:
 - I'm comfortable with the basics of FP from Haskell including a theoretical understanding of monads, functors, applicative. I can work with the IO monad, bind operator, 'do' syntax. I also understand that list and maybe are also monads. I'd never heavily applied these concepts outside of games. 
 - Read and did exercises from [most of this book](https://books.underscore.io/essential-scala/essential-scala.html#getting-started)
 - Built a sloppy, unfinished hangman to get used to language (link)
 - Followed [this tutorial](https://scalac.io/blog/introduction-to-programming-with-zio-functional-effects/) without deep understanding just to understand the structure and though process

#### Todo:
 - Redo the tutorial and try to build it myself. Basically building muscle memory, get a deeper understanding of the program structure and types
 - Create other games with ZIO
 - Create small real world app

ZIO is more like an ecosystem than a tooling library, similar to React (middle ground between a framework and a library)
