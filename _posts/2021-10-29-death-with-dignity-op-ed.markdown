Something I've heard repeatedly from older, mentally healthy people is that they wouldn't want to keep living if they had severe dementia. Then there are two end-of-life narratives that follow: their life ends without ever having severe dementia, or they get severe dementia and live with it for an indefinite amount of time until they die (usually not directly from dementia). We need to build the business and legal processes to enable the end-of-life choice to not live with severe dementia.

Because a dementia-related wish to die is different in nature than a terminally-ill-induced wish to die, we need a different mindset and process.

Currently, the two main hurdles for somebody with severe dementia to take advantage of physician-assisted dying are that you need to be<sup>[[1]](https://deathwithdignity.org/learn/access/#Eligibility)</sup>:
1. "mentally competent, i.e. capable of making and communicating your health care decisions"
2. "diagnosed with a terminal illness that will, within reasonable medical judgment, lead to death within six months" 

I'll assume the reasons for these requirements are that we want to ensure that:
1. this is the patient's choice
2. they are not making a short-sighted decision, and there is a strong guarantee that their medical condition won't improve

The presumed reasons for these laws are consistant with the reasons somebody with severe dementia would want to take advantage of physician-assisted dying given:
1. while they were mentally competent they've expressed they wouldn't want to keep living if they ever have severe dementia 
2. we haven't found a cure for severe dementia

Canada, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the Netherlands have legalized some form of physician-assisted death and / or euthanasia for patients with severe dementia, though it's unclear how often it's been applied to that demographic.<sup>[[2]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.622446/full)</sup>

In the US, there are two main logistical hurdles for people who wish to end their life once they have severe dementia: 
1. They're not able to make their own medical decisions
2. There are no established business and legal procedures to follow

Imagine that assisted dying is legal for people with severe dementia, but there is not a well-defined procedure for making the decision and carrying out the request. 
Here are a few common scenarios (I'm speculating that these are common mostly through empirical evidence!):

- there is a parent who has adult children, and the parent expresses the wish to not continue living if they get severe dementia
- the parent starts to get mild dementia, realizes it, but they struggle navigating the business / legal processes to put it in place. Even if they manage to plan it, the children will rebel with the argument that their mildly demented parent can't make these decisions for themself anymore
- the children have some sort of medical power of attorney agreement over their parent. They know of their parents wish but can't come to a consensus of how or when to move forward, both logistically and emotionally

or

- there is a spouse
...........

The logistics around an assisted death law for somebody with severe dementia are much more complicated than somebody with a six-month prognosis.
We need to define the following: 
- when is the decision made
- who is involved
	* family (spouse, children, grandchildren)
	* doctors
	* emotional / psychological support
	* legal support
- processes in the years that follow the decision 
- how the decision can be redacted
	* by who
	* on what timeline



Current access to assisted dying is limited in the type of people it addresses. Assisted dying should be an option for all in end-of-life planning. 

Plan to make this legal:
- start a business / non-profit
	* very clear business plan, incentives align
	* very good leadership, incentivised correctly
	* community-driven decisions
	* somehow limit concentration of power
	* I think limiting the amount of money the org has can help with this (ie, very bootstrapped,)
	* but not just an advocating org. Needs to be an org that actually provides services as if it were legal, with the intention that it's legal in 20 years. I think this will help align incentives

Create a process


I'm thinking about a non-profit that does education around doc assisted suicide and also helps with elderly planning for people who are interested in doc assistedsuicide if they end up meeting certain criteria later in life. Like dementia or debilitating pain or major decline in quality of life.

1. I think it's a huge underserved market. People say they want it but there'snot commonly known avenues to get there. Then it's too late and their kids have power of attorney and feel like they can't make that decision so they keep their miserable parent alive for 5-10k / month. I think it's a combination of a huge emotianal hurdle and it being a difficult situation when others have some say in the decision (siblings, spouce).

2. All baby boomers will be there in 10-30 years and will be a resource sink and toll on all younger generations and economy.

I think people want it so it's really just creating the vehicles to make it possible and accessible, some reframing, and education.


Premices is that there aren't commonly know avenues for DAS. We don't have the culture around it. "When you're 60 you make a will or succession plan", but there's not a culture around talking about what happens when you get dementia or when your life sucks and your kids have power of attorney.

Education
Creating vehicles
Put somethingin place before they can't do anything. Meaning somebody else has POA, they can't make decisions for themselves. Or even if nobody else has POA, they probably don't have the skills / energy / agency anymore to do the planning. If it's not in their face, even if they say they want it, it's very likely it's not prioritized, then 10 years pass and they start declining and nothing actionable has happened since.

We could make it a common thing to talk about, what happens in 20 or 30 years when you're in that position. People know if they want to be buried or cremated or body donated to science. People know where they want their money going and where they want their money spend, and what kind of funural they want. 

The hardest technical challange and maybe social challange might be where to draw the line. I think the solution is to have better quantitative metrics on state of dementia and quality of life.

Maybe we do have quantitative tools to measure severity of alztimers or degree of pain, but as far as I know they're still qualitative and subjective. 

Need to develop quantitative markers.

So you can say "when I reach level 7 it's time for DAC"

And even if those measures are somewhat subjective, say you set your marker at 7 and doctors later can't decide if you're a 6 or 7 or 8, even though that is a slight problem and would cause some years of messiness, eventually all the doctors, even the most conservative ones, will agree that you're a 7 (or above), then you can do DAC and you don't have to wait til level 10 like we do now.

Another challange will be incentive aligning. Doctors, children, lawyers, (this non-profit organization idea). Financial and emotional (mostly financial)

Other reason for this is baby boomers in 10 - 30 years will all be here. Nursing homes suck. Lots of people don't want their parents living with them when their old and sick. Can also be thought of as a way to avoid predatory nursing homes. All the other options are bad. There are no good options here, and maybe this could look like the better of the options in everybodies eyes. It's gonna be a huge economic and emotional burden on younger generations and economy. 

Don't know how to pursue this. Where my energy should go. What first steps are. 
Step 1: Does anything like this exist or has it existed in the past and if so what does it look like, and what is it missing. Because if it does exist, it's clearly missing something because the culture and mindset around this is not where lots of people think it should be. Or they just aren't doing it enought. With baby boomers, if there's a time to be thinking about it, it's not and in the next 10 - 30 years.

Main value areas:
Raising awareness through advocacy and education
Creating the legal and business pathways 
Guiding people through the process both mentally and emotionally (they can void the plan at anytime)
Could have a support group for people. Or just a community of people who are planning DAS
Making family part of the planning process
Creating a clear roadmap for people, and helping them / reminding them along the way:
 
1. Talking to somebody to help you think about your options, and what the options mean for you (how to prepare for this emotionally and mentally)
2. Help get plan / legal paperwork in order
3. Check ins 
4. Evaluation (patient / client can refute results at anytime and void or delay plan)
5. DAS and family support

The wiki is good. Section on US polls. Wording of DAS / DAD really matters here. 'Terminally ill' vs 'severe pain', 'patient suicide' vs 'physician-administered voluntary euthanasia'

Wiki seems to focus on terminally ill, but mentally sound patients. I want to focus on dementia and getting the right paperwork in order before dementia. Very different from what wiki is covering
