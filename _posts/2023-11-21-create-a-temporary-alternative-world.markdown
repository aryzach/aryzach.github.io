We met at book club to talk about Ch 5 in Art of Gathering : Create a Temporary Alternative World

Here is a brief of some of our thoughts.

### Some guidelines to help us create the rules for our temporary alternative world 

a good rule: 

- gives permission to everybody to do something weird / risky that they might not do otherwise (courtesy Audrey)
- encourages risk taking to connect with others
- helps people connect with other individuals or the group
- makes everybody feel like you're in a special world
- facilitates conversations / interactions that might not happen otherwise


### example rules:

- "titties!" When going on an adventure, each member gets a "titties" where they get to pick an impromptu side quest with everybodys buy-in (Georgia / David)
- rubics cube party. 6 colors. Everybody picks one color to dress in, and wears 6 articles of clothing with that color. The goal for everybody is that by the end of the night everybody has one article of each color accumulated by trading (Audrey)
- "I am here" day. Dedicate a whole day adventure together. Minimal planning. Default down. Minimize distractions. Opt-in means committing to the entire day. Pick a neighborhood and explore together (from book)
- work together for a day to set up wedding (Jackie)
