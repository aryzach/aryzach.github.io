_includes and _data holds things about the navigation bar

to serve locally, run 'bundle exec jekyll serve'
I'm not sure why 'jekyll serve' doesn't work

can make a new post with 'octopress new post "My Awesome Post"'

only _layouts/default.html contains css file. Any other layout used needs to use front matter to inherit the css

never touch _site, this is generated by jekyll
