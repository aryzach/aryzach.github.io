    <h1>Reimplementing Git Clone with Scala / ZIO</h1>
<p>29 Aug 2021 </p>

<p>SWE practices I’ll follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write unit tests before writing code (kinda TDD, but really the development is driven by the original blog post)</li>
  <li>Only function-level comments (no in-function comments)</li>
  <li>Self-commenting code (will likely follow naming convensions from the Haskell implementation)</li>
  <li>Git commit often (no set rule, but after every function, major milestone, bug fix)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll break the project up into phases. Phase 1 is completing the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Parse the clone url to extract the host, port and repository path information.</li>
  <li>Connect to the git server via TCP using the native git transport protocol.</li>
  <li>Negotiate the objects that need to be transferrered from the server to the client. This includes receiving the current state of the remote repository (in the form of a ref advertisement) that includes the refs the server has and for each ref the commit hash it points to.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-1-read-post-and-understand-at-a-high-level">Step 1: Read post and understand at a high level</h4>
<p>Half way through, the post became overwhelming. I decided to skim for a high level overview for the rest, and focus on a deep understanding of <a href="https://stefan.saasen.me/articles/git-clone-in-haskell-from-the-bottom-up/#git-transport-and-pack-wire-protocol">git transport and pack wire protocal</a> so that I can start implementing that part of it.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-understand-first-requirement-and-build-one-test-for-it---ref-discovery">Step 2: Understand first requirement, and build one test for it - Ref discovery</h4>
<p>This will complete step 1 - 3 of the git clone process</p>

<h4 id="step-3-write-code-to-pass-test">Step 3: Write code to pass test</h4>
<p>Done. I should probably write more tests for better coverage, but my goal is to get a working program quickly, not one that will be put in production / care about resiliency.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-write-ls-remote-function-this-uses-io-ill-start-using-zio-test-instead-of-scalatest">Step 4: Write ls-remote function. This uses IO. I’ll start using zio-test instead of scalatest.</h4>
<p>I moved all tests to use the zio-test framework. I’ll still figure out what the test for this should look like.</p>

<h4 id="step-5-ls-remote-sends-a-message-over-tcp-ill-have-to-learn-a-bit-about-how-tcp-works-the-actor-model-etc">Step 5: ls-remote sends a message over TCP. I’ll have to learn a bit about how TCP works, the actor model, etc.</h4>
<p>I’m reading about TCP / Akka actors on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33747858/akka-tcp-client-how-can-i-send-a-message-over-tcp-using-akka-actor">stackoverflow</a> and from the <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/io-tcp.html?language=scala">official docs</a> to understand how I can send a TCP message in Scala. I think the ZIO environments I’ll need are System and maybe Blocking. I haven’t worked with either of these ZIO environments, so that’ll be fun to learn about!</p>
