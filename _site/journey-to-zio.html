    <h1>Journey to ZIO</h1>
<p>08 Jul 2021 </p>

<p>I have a job lined up working in Scala and will make heavy use of ZIO. This is a brief and working post about how I’m getting there.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="so-far">So far:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I’m comfortable with the basics of FP from Haskell including a theoretical understanding of monads, functors, applicative. I can work with the IO monad, bind operator, ‘do’ syntax. I also understand that list and maybe are also monads. I’d never heavily applied these concepts outside of games.</li>
  <li>Read and did exercises from <a href="https://books.underscore.io/essential-scala/essential-scala.html#getting-started">most of this book</a></li>
  <li>Built a sloppy, unfinished hangman to get used to language (link)</li>
  <li>Followed <a href="https://scalac.io/blog/introduction-to-programming-with-zio-functional-effects/">this tutorial</a> without deep understanding just to understand the structure and though process</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="todo">Todo:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Redo the tutorial and try to build it myself. Basically building muscle memory, get a deeper understanding of the program structure and types</li>
  <li>Create other games with ZIO</li>
  <li>Create small real world app</li>
</ul>

<p>ZIO is more like an ecosystem than a tooling library, similar to React (middle ground between a framework and a library)</p>
