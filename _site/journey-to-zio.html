    <h1>Journey to ZIO</h1>
<p>08 Jul 2021 </p>

<p>I have a job lined up working in Scala and will make heavy use of ZIO. This is a brief and working post about how I’m getting there.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="so-far">So far:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I’m comfortable with the basics of FP from Haskell including a theoretical understanding of monads, functors, applicative. I can work with the IO monad, bind operator, ‘do’ syntax. I also understand that list and maybe are also monads. I’d never heavily applied these concepts outside of games.</li>
  <li>Read and did exercises from <a href="https://books.underscore.io/essential-scala/essential-scala.html#getting-started">most of this book</a></li>
  <li>Built a sloppy, unfinished hangman to get used to language (link)</li>
  <li>Followed <a href="https://scalac.io/blog/introduction-to-programming-with-zio-functional-effects/">this tutorial</a>. The first time through without deep understanding just to understand the structure and though process. I then rebuilt it mostly to build muscle memory, get a deeper understanding of the program structure and types</li>
  <li>Built the game from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=sxudIMiOo68">FP to the Max</a> with ZIO before watching how John De Goes does it. Then I followed along as he build App1, which I understood fairly comfortably. In App2 he builds monads from scratch, which, before he said it, I thought I’d seen it before, and I recognized that the TestIO was similar to the state monad. When he started breaking down IO into Console and Random, that looks plainly like the ZIO types. While I was already beyond my comfort level at this point, I really like the idea of getting to this level of understanding of working in FP and types. While I only understand App2 and App3 at a high level, it makes me excited to work towards this level of understanding, and I think I’ll get there much faster if I’m building real world applications with the FP mindset.</li>
  <li>I’m getting side tracked and started watching and following along with the series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwMKw03w8bs&amp;list=PLJGDHERh23x-ammk-n2XuZWhoRVB-wAF">ZIO from DevInsideYou</a> which I’m finding insightful and demystifying, but lost at the covarience / contravarience discussion.</li>
  <li>Started building a Tic Tac Toe game, but stopped when I felt I wasn’t learning much more.</li>
  <li>FP to the Min</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="todo">Todo:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>FP to the Min</li>
  <li>Create other games with ZIO</li>
  <li>Create small real world ZIO app, ideally something that needs concurrency / async</li>
  <li>Create online multiplayer CLI game using Play framework and ZIO</li>
</ul>

<p>ZIO is more like an ecosystem than a tooling library, similar to React (middle ground between a framework and a library)</p>
