<p>(or ‘evidence suggests that’ and cite it) Something I’ve heard repeatedly from older, mentally healthy people is that they wouldn’t want to keep living if they had severe dementia. Then there are two end-of-life narratives that follow: their life ends without ever having severe dementia, or they get severe dementia and live with it for an indefinite amount of time until they die (usually not directly from dementia). We need to build the business and legal processes to enable the end-of-life choice to not live with severe dementia.</p>

<p>Because a dementia-related wish to die is different in nature than a terminally-ill-induced wish to die, we need a different mindset and process.</p>

<p>Currently, the two main hurdles for somebody with severe dementia to take advantage of the physician-assisted dying law are that you need to be<sup><a href="https://deathwithdignity.org/learn/access/#Eligibility">[1]</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>“mentally competent, i.e. capable of making and communicating your health care decisions”</li>
  <li>“diagnosed with a terminal illness that will, within reasonable medical judgment, lead to death within six months”</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll assume the reasons for these requirements are that we want to ensure that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>this is the patient’s choice</li>
  <li>they are not making a short-sighted decision, and there is a strong guarantee that their medical condition won’t improve</li>
</ol>

<p>The presumed reasons for these laws are consistant with the reasons somebody with severe dementia would want to take advantage of physician-assisted dying given:</p>
<ol>
  <li>while they were mentally competent they’ve expressed they wouldn’t want to keep living if they ever have severe dementia</li>
  <li>we haven’t found a cure for severe dementia</li>
</ol>

<p>Canada, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the Netherlands have legalized some form of physician-assisted death and / or euthanasia for patients with severe dementia, though it’s unclear how often it’s been applied to that demographic.<sup><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.622446/full">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the US, there are two main logistical hurdles for people who wish to end their life once they have severe dementia:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They’re not able to make their own medical decisions</li>
  <li>There are no established business and legal procedures to follow</li>
</ol>

<p>Imagine that assisted dying is legal for people with severe dementia, but there is not a well-defined procedure for making the request and carrying out the request. 
Here are a few common scenarios (I’m speculating that these are common mostly through observation!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a parent who has adult children, and the parent expresses the wish to not continue living if they get severe dementia</li>
  <li>the parent starts to get mild dementia, realizes it, but they struggle navigating the business / legal processes to put it in place. Even if they manage to plan it, the children will rebel with the argument that their mildly demented parent can’t make these decisions for themself anymore</li>
  <li>the children have some sort of medical power of attorney agreement over their parent. They know of their parents wish but can’t come to a consensus of how or when to move forward, both logistically and emotionally</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a spouse
………..</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outline-of-legal-decisions-to-be-made">Outline of legal decisions to be made</h3>

<p>The logistics around an assisted death law for somebody with severe dementia are much more complicated than somebody with a six-month prognosis.
As a basic framework, we need to define the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when is the request made</li>
  <li>who is involved
    <ul>
      <li>family (spouse, children, grandchildren)</li>
      <li>doctors</li>
      <li>emotional / psychological support</li>
      <li>legal support</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>agenda in the years that follow the request
    <ul>
      <li>dementia status check-ins</li>
      <li>emotional check-ins</li>
      <li>legal check-ins (the laws could change in the 2 - 30 years between request and action)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>how the request can be redacted
    <ul>
      <li>by who</li>
      <li>on what timeline</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nonprofit-business-plan">Nonprofit Business Plan</h3>

<h4 id="why-now">Why now?</h4>

<p>A nonprofit with the mission to legalize assisted dying for those with severe dementia is in a unique and privileged position. I can foresee the following independently each taking roughly 10 - 20 years to mature:</p>
<ul>
  <li>legal work to legalize assisted dying for people with severe dementia</li>
  <li>development and implementation of the systems and business infrastructure to support the practice</li>
  <li>culture to embrace the practice</li>
</ul>

<p>This conveniently aligns with those in their 60’s to 80’s who share a common sentiment to not want to continue to live if they have severe dementia. This group of people, in 10 - 20 years, will be in a position where they have a higher chance of having some form of dementia. Now is a particularly unique time to act because the size of that age demographic is big (how do I say this? baby boomers).</p>

<p>These circumstances open up unique advocacy and fundraising advantages. Those who will directly benefit in 10 - 20 years can bootstrap this idea. They can be first clients, helping fund the mission, and those retired might want to do paid, volunteer, or general advocacy work.</p>

<p>And we can structure and align the nonprofit in such a way that the preparation services are immediately useful for them by providing legal and family / emotional support (the idea would be to perform the preperation services as if we knew it would be legal. This could be troublesome because if a law doesn’t pass in time, then it might be emotionally harmful for clients).</p>

<h4 id="timeline">Timeline</h4>
<ul>
  <li>year 1 - year 2:   education + define policy and business models + townhalls</li>
  <li>year 3 - year 20:  services + education + advocacy + policy and business model refinement</li>
  <li>year 15 - year 20: pass bill 
(what is the legal process timeline? Official submit, approval / denial, next steps, challenging outcomes, etc)
(need to do research to build a better estimated timeline. Look at death with dignity, and other bills like marijuana)</li>
</ul>

<p>In year 1 and 2, the dialog from the townhalls and education programs will inform the policy draft and initial business plan, and vice versa. In years 3-7, we’ll implement the business plan and refine it along the way. The organization and mission should begin to take a more concrete shape and have better-defined legal and cultural goals. Performing services will be an iterative process, and once we start implementing the business model, we will learn things that will make us want to improve or pivot the services.</p>

<p>(I believe it will take roughly this long because it will support many more people and require more peripheral support systems compared to the terminally-ill assisted death model)</p>

<h4 id="vibe">Vibe</h4>

<p>Death and money are two strong forces. An organization like this could easily devolve into a business that chases inheritances and possibly loses sight of it’s mission. This organization should be structured in a way where the organization, employees, and members are never financially, emotionally, or politically incentivised to influence individual decisions around assisted death.</p>

<p>The business plan for the provided services must be clear, commonly agreed upon, and held to that standard. The leadership, doctors, lawyers, and other service providers involved must be incentivised appropriately.</p>

<p>Build a culture of…</p>
<ul>
  <li>listening to older people - don’t let the organization get dominated by career-ists</li>
  <li>community-driven organizational decisions</li>
  <li>checks and balances - ensure the service providers don’t influence individual decisions</li>
</ul>

<p>Some suggested practical guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>explicitly forbid financial succession planning services</li>
  <li>flat fee or sliding scale pricing model for services- net worth or inheritance should never be involved</li>
  <li>no outside funding - align organization soley with customers, and never be incentivized to please, prioritize, or give weight to non-customer donors (this might be part of why lots of non-profits get watered-down)
    <ul>
      <li>maybe even, once services are provided, disallow donations outside of services. This would help to incentivize prioritizing clients, and not let clients buy power (I think large donors, even if well-intentioned, can disrupt power dynamics, goals, and trajectory)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>no investments (this might be disallowed for non-profits anyway)</li>
</ul>

<p>These guidelines will all help to tightly couple service and mission, and incentivize the organization to provide the best service possible to clients both directly and through legal representation of the group. My fear here is that if lack of money is limiting growth or not enough to pay people appropriately, the organization might come up with clever ways to make more money from clients, but in ways that don’t provide a lot of client value. I think this would mean that the guidelines are artificially limiting, and actually disservicing the mission and clients. The goal of these guidelines are to have the ‘right’ amount of money - enough for the mission to be successful, have traction and grow, but not so much that the wrong people are incentivized to lead, or that the organization choses to priorizite the larger sources of money.</p>

<p>Some other thoughts about building the culture and appropriate incentives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>somehow limit concentration of power</li>
  <li>I think limiting the amount of money the org has can help with this (ie, very bootstrapped, no outside funding or “investments”)</li>
  <li>but not just an advocating org. Needs to be an org that actually provides services as if it were legal, with the intention that it’s legal in 20 years. I think this will help align incentives</li>
  <li>“customer-owned cooperative”</li>
  <li>each customer has one vote no matter how much money donated (not sure if I like this idea, sounds messy, chaotic, political. need to have clear political direction and leadership. This could bring in too much internal politics and cause division)</li>
  <li>how to incentivize the business to incorporate the changes customers want? changes to both service provided and the proposed law. I think just focusing on listening, townhalls, and propping up the right people to lead this</li>
</ul>

<p>Current access to assisted dying is limited in the type of people it addresses. Assisted dying should be an option for all in end-of-life planning.</p>

<p>This will also be a much bigger industry than the current scope of assisted dying.</p>

<p>people who are possibly the closest to the issue in many ways (emotional, know people who are going through this)</p>

<p>I’m thinking about a non-profit that does education around doc assisted suicide and also helps with elderly planning for people who are interested in doc assistedsuicide if they end up meeting certain criteria later in life. Like dementia or debilitating pain or major decline in quality of life.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I think it’s a huge underserved market. People say they want it but there’snot commonly known avenues to get there. Then it’s too late and their kids have power of attorney and feel like they can’t make that decision so they keep their miserable parent alive for 5-10k / month. I think it’s a combination of a huge emotianal hurdle and it being a difficult situation when others have some say in the decision (siblings, spouce).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All baby boomers will be there in 10-30 years and will be a resource sink and toll on all younger generations and economy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think people want it so it’s really just creating the vehicles to make it possible and accessible, some reframing, and education.</p>

<p>Premices is that there aren’t commonly know avenues for DAS. We don’t have the culture around it. “When you’re 60 you make a will or succession plan”, but there’s not a culture around talking about what happens when you get dementia or when your life sucks and your kids have power of attorney.</p>

<p>Education
Creating vehicles
Put somethingin place before they can’t do anything. Meaning somebody else has POA, they can’t make decisions for themselves. Or even if nobody else has POA, they probably don’t have the skills / energy / agency anymore to do the planning. If it’s not in their face, even if they say they want it, it’s very likely it’s not prioritized, then 10 years pass and they start declining and nothing actionable has happened since.</p>

<p>We could make it a common thing to talk about, what happens in 20 or 30 years when you’re in that position. People know if they want to be buried or cremated or body donated to science. People know where they want their money going and where they want their money spend, and what kind of funural they want.</p>

<p>The hardest technical challange and maybe social challange might be where to draw the line. I think the solution is to have better quantitative metrics on state of dementia and quality of life.</p>

<p>Maybe we do have quantitative tools to measure severity of alztimers or degree of pain, but as far as I know they’re still qualitative and subjective.</p>

<p>Need to develop quantitative markers.</p>

<p>So you can say “when I reach level 7 it’s time for DAC”</p>

<p>And even if those measures are somewhat subjective, say you set your marker at 7 and doctors later can’t decide if you’re a 6 or 7 or 8, even though that is a slight problem and would cause some years of messiness, eventually all the doctors, even the most conservative ones, will agree that you’re a 7 (or above), then you can do DAC and you don’t have to wait til level 10 like we do now.</p>

<p>Another challange will be incentive aligning. Doctors, children, lawyers, (this non-profit organization idea). Financial and emotional (mostly financial)</p>

<p>Other reason for this is baby boomers in 10 - 30 years will all be here. Nursing homes suck. Lots of people don’t want their parents living with them when their old and sick. Can also be thought of as a way to avoid predatory nursing homes. All the other options are bad. There are no good options here, and maybe this could look like the better of the options in everybodies eyes. It’s gonna be a huge economic and emotional burden on younger generations and economy.</p>

<p>Don’t know how to pursue this. Where my energy should go. What first steps are. 
Step 1: Does anything like this exist or has it existed in the past and if so what does it look like, and what is it missing. Because if it does exist, it’s clearly missing something because the culture and mindset around this is not where lots of people think it should be. Or they just aren’t doing it enought. With baby boomers, if there’s a time to be thinking about it, it’s not and in the next 10 - 30 years.</p>

<p>This topic is sensitive, and for good cause. I think the general consensus in the US is that we know that some people with severe dementia don’t want to keep living, either because they’ve expressed it before or because they express it at the time, but we don’t have general consensus that we should allow them to die. Fulfilling the wishes of those with severe dementia will require a general mindset shift.</p>

<p>Additionally, 
Because of how sensitive the issue is, and because we’re dealing with peoples lives</p>

<p>Main value areas:
Raising awareness through advocacy and education
Creating the legal and business pathways 
Guiding people through the process both mentally and emotionally (they can void the plan at anytime)
Could have a support group for people. Or just a community of people who are planning DAS
Making family part of the planning process
Creating a clear roadmap for people, and helping them / reminding them along the way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Talking to somebody to help you think about your options, and what the options mean for you (how to prepare for this emotionally and mentally)</li>
  <li>Help get plan / legal paperwork in order</li>
  <li>Check ins</li>
  <li>Evaluation (patient / client can refute results at anytime and void or delay plan)</li>
  <li>DAS and family support</li>
</ol>

<p>The wiki is good. Section on US polls. Wording of DAS / DAD really matters here. ‘Terminally ill’ vs ‘severe pain’, ‘patient suicide’ vs ‘physician-administered voluntary euthanasia’</p>

<p>Wiki seems to focus on terminally ill, but mentally sound patients. I want to focus on dementia and getting the right paperwork in order before dementia. Very different from what wiki is covering</p>

<h2 id="things-to-do---first-steps">Things to do - first steps:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>get into acquired community. Learn culture, see where approriate to talk about this idea</li>
  <li>obv post op ed, but also reach out to Death with Dignity group</li>
  <li>really get to know histories of:
    <ul>
      <li>assisted dying</li>
      <li>death with dignity, both organization and timeline of how the law was passed</li>
      <li>history of one of the most recent biggest movements - legalization of marijuana</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>basics of how a law like this would be passed. I’m so ignorant of the legal process here
    <ul>
      <li>whats the general process</li>
      <li>main hurdles for this type of law</li>
      <li>costs?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>talk on twitter about these ideas? both current death with dignity law and future of law for people with severe dementia?</li>
  <li>reddit groups</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first-momentum-steps">First momentum steps:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>talk to people. Related groups, business / legal people, and more importantly, old people who want this option for themselves</li>
  <li>Once I know a lot and can talk about all areas of law, history, currest status, then come up with a first-iteration scope and plan of what a consultation would look like. Then talk with people for free at first both for their benefit, to practice, get feedback, and see what they would want as a service</li>
</ul>
