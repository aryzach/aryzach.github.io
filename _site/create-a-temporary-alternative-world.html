    <h1 class=postTitle>Create a Temporary Alternative World</h1>
<p>01 Dec 2023 </p>

<p>We met at book club to talk about Ch 5 in Art of Gathering : Create a Temporary Alternative World</p>

<p>Here is a brief of some of our thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="some-guidelines-to-help-us-create-the-rules-for-our-temporary-alternative-world">Some guidelines to help us create the rules for our temporary alternative world</h3>

<p>a good rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gives permission to everybody to do something weird / risky that they might not do otherwise (courtesy Audrey)</li>
  <li>encourages risk taking to connect with others</li>
  <li>helps people connect with other individuals or the group</li>
  <li>makes everybody feel like you’re in a special world</li>
  <li>facilitates conversations / interactions that might not happen otherwise</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-rules">example rules:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>“titties!” When going on an adventure, each member gets a “titties” where they get to pick an impromptu side quest with everybodys buy-in (Georgia / David)</li>
  <li>rubics cube party. 6 colors. Everybody picks one color to dress in, and wears 6 articles of clothing with that color. The goal for everybody is that by the end of the night everybody has one article of each color accumulated by trading (Audrey)</li>
  <li>“I am here” day. Dedicate a whole day adventure together. Minimal planning. Default down. Minimize distractions. Opt-in means committing to the entire day. Pick a neighborhood and explore together (from book)</li>
  <li>work together for a day to set up wedding (Jackie)</li>
</ul>

		// to remove space around images (bc they were wrapped with a <p> tag which adds padding/margin
		const allPTags = document.querySelectorAll("p");

		allPTags.forEach((elem) => {
				console.log(elem.childNodes[0].tagName);
				console.log(elem.parentNode);

				if (elem.childNodes.length === 1 && elem.childNodes[0].tagName === "IMG") {
						elem.parentNode.insertBefore(elem.childNodes[0], elem);
						elem.remove();
