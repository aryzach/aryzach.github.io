<ul>
  <li>change scala version in build.sbt</li>
  <li>still wasn’t running, debugged RectRegion, so now only one type of block shows</li>
  <li>few other small bugs to get it running</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll start by just trying to get all piece shapes back in the game. When debugging, I cound this fragment:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>val allPossiblePieces: Seq[RectRegion] = { 
// is this a monoid?
def multF[A](f: A =&gt; A)(times: Int): A =&gt; A = 
  (1 to times).foldLeft(identity[A](_))((c, _) =&gt; c andThen f)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The comment “is this a monoid?” tells me I’m in a good place, because it shows me the original writer understands these concepts just a little better than I do, so hopefully this excersise will push me to their level.</p>
