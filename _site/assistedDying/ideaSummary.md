Something I’ve heard repeatedly from older, mentally healthy people is that they wouldn’t want to keep living if they had severe dementia. Then there are two end-of-life narratives that follow: their life ends without ever having severe dementia, or they get severe dementia and live with it for an indefinite amount of time until they die (usually not directly from dementia). We need to build the business and legal processes to enable the end-of-life choice to not live with severe dementia.

The main idea is to provide preparatory legal and counseling services to elderly people 50 - 65 years old that would allow them to participate in an assisted death in the case that they do get dementia later in their life. We will use that money to provide services but also build a campaign to pass the law, so if / when the law is passed, they will be able to exercise their new rights. The idea is that it will take roughly 10 - 20 years to pass this law, which lines up with when they're more likely to have dementia. The participants will know that there is a chance this law doesn't get passed and they won't have the right to participate in assisted death.
