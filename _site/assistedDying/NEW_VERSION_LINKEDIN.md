My Grandpa never wanted to live with dementia. 

Our healthcare system failed him and many others.

We need to build the legal processes to extend end-of-life options to those with dementia. 

We propose an organization to bootstrap the legal changes needed enable assisted death for those with dementia (details in article). 

If you'd like to talk about your experience dealing with dementia, would like to get involved, or know somebody who might, please reach out.

My Grandpa never wanted to live with dementia. For most of my life, he was cavalier with his wish. He didn't mention it often, but it always hit me when he did. It felt both serious and lighthearted, but never sad. He was more concerned about what would happen with his black dog, Abby.

After diagnosis, it became "Get me a damn gun." Now it was serious and sad.

When he started showing signs, we moved him to Michigan from South Carolina. On one hand, I got to spend cherished time with him after he moved. On the other hand, this isn't about me. He would've been much happier passing on to his version of the afterlife by way of an ice cream-only diet in his small southern ranch.

My family and our healthcare system failed to fulfill his desires. This story haunts so many elderly.

Making change

(wordy and technical, but bear with me)

Many older, mentally healthy people say they don't want to continue to live if they get dementia. We currently have two paths: 

never get dementia

get dementia and live for an indefinite amount of time, often 5+ years

We need to build the business and legal processes to enable the end-of-life choice to not live with dementia. 

Two main hurdles for a dementia patient to take advantage of current assisted dying laws (End of Life Option Act) in many US states are that you need to be: 

”mentally competent, i.e. capable of making and communicating your health care decisions”

”diagnosed with a terminal illness that will, within reasonable medical judgment, lead to death within six months”

We have these rules to ensure that: 

this is the patient’s choice

this is not a short-sighted decision— their medical condition will continue to decline 

The reasons for these rules are consistent with why somebody with dementia would want to take advantage of assisted dying:

expressed desire for assisted death while mentally competent under condition they get dementia— patient's choice

no cure for dementia— not a short-sighted decision

Death with Dignity, the primary organization leading assisted death legislation in the US, is not currently pursuing laws to help legalize in the case of dementia. 

We propose an organization to bootstrap the legal changes needed enable assisted death for those with dementia. This organization will both help specify the proposed legislation and provide preparatory services likely required in the proposed legislation in anticipation of the bill becoming a law (explained below).

Legal decisions to be made 

The logistics around a dementia assisted death law are more complicated than what the law currently covers under the End of Life Option Act. We need to address the following:

when does the request for assisted death have to be made?

who is involved?— family, dementia doctors, psychologists, legal 

periodic checkpoints following the request— dementia status, psychological status, legal status of proposed law 

how can the request be redacted?— by who and on what timeline

Business Plan  

Mission: Expand access of assisted dying to those with dementia. 

legalize the practice

establish systems to support the practice 

Whether through ballot initiative or the legislative process, the common way to pass a law like this would be to raise money through donations and advocate. 

The main idea in this effort is to take a different approach to community organizing, fundraising, and building a critical mass of engaged supporters. 

We hope to leverage the unique position of the first group to benefit from a change of law (seniors) to help the mission by bootstrapping that process with capital, labor, and mission-alignment. We plan to do this by providing anticipatory legal, business, and emotional support services to those who wish to take advantage of an assisted dying law should they get dementia. 

Why now?

An organization with the mission to legalize assisted dying for those with dementia is in a unique and privileged position. We foresee the following independently each taking roughly 5 - 10 years to mature:

legal work to legalize assisted dying for people with dementia 

development and implementation of the systems and business infrastructure to support the practice

culture to embrace the practice 

This conveniently aligns with 60 - 80 year olds who share a common sentiment to not want to continue to live if they have dementia. This group of people, in 5 - 20 years, will be in a position where they have a higher chance of having dementia. Now is a particularly unique time to act because the relatively large size of the boomer demographic.

These circumstances open up unique advocacy and fundraising advantages. Those who will directly benefit in 5 - 20 years can help bootstrap this idea. They will be the first clients, helping fund the mission, and those retired might want to contribute to the mission through paid or volunteer advocacy work. 

And we can structure and align the organization in such a way that the preparation services are immediately useful for them by providing legal, family, and emotional support to prepare for their assisted death in the case they get dementia. 

(If a law doesn’t pass in time, some clients might not get their wishes fulfilled. We will be explicit and obvious that this is a likely possibility). 

Timeline 

year 1 - year 2: education + define policy and business models + townhalls 

year 3 - year 20: services + education + advocacy + policy and business model refinement

year 15 - year 20: pass bill

In year 1 and 2, the dialog from the town halls and education programs will inform the policy draft and initial business plan, and vice versa. In years 3-7, we’ll implement the business plan and refine it along the way. The organization and mission should begin to take a more concrete shape and have better-defined legal and cultural goals. Performing services will be an iterative process, and once we start implementing the business model, we will learn things that will make us want to improve or pivot the services. 

(We believe it will take roughly this long because it will support many more people and require more peripheral support systems compared to the terminally-ill assisted death model) 

Defining policy and business model 

Much like other medical procedures, business model follows policy, and the two will be necessarily coupled. We’ve outlined some of the questions that will need to be answered in the section ’Outline of legal decisions to be made’. In the end, the law will determine the necessary business infrastructure and processes, but until then, we have to think about and build the process that the community is comfortable with. We believe making this a community-driven process will create the best outcome both legally and culturally. Ideally, the community gives input about what processes would be most helpful to them and their families. This inherently informs us of what processes should be legally required by law to ensure every assisted death is decided upon and carried out in a way that minimizes ambiguity and where everybody is in agreeance that this is what the patient wants. We also believe this communal agreeance on processes will help the law get passed, which will necessitate the processes we propose. 

Education and town halls 

Education events and events where we receive feedback will mostly be a blurred line until the proposed policy and business models are better defined and in practice. We think the first year might look like a large, crowd-sourced, organized brainstorming session with a clear goal. While we believe that this bootstrapped business model will be a fruitful path to some form of legalized assisted dying for those with dementia, there are a lot of policy and business details that would be better decided by a community of interested parties. Additionally, educating and empowering others to contribute will help people be part of the mission, contribute to a brighter future, and be invested in the outcome. It’ll also increase the power behind the mission, both in numbers and passion. Lastly, even if we wrote the most optimal policy and submitted it today, we doubt it would pass. Historically, having a lot of motivated people behind a grassroots push for policy change has led to success. 

Proposed education topics: 

history of Death with Dignity 

history of assisted death— old cultures that practice(d) planned death, when and why it was forbidden, where and how it’s still practiced 

what we know so far about what this law would look like 

history and timeline of similar laws 

how to talk about this with their families / to other people 

Proposed feedback topics: 

what they would want out of this

feedback about proposed process, or if they have new ideas for process 

feedback from family members 

feedback from religious groups 

feedback from lawyers 

feedback from doctors 

feedback from counselors 

feedback from all interested parties 

Services 

As we’ve explained above, the main idea here is to bootstrap the passing of an assisted dying policy for those with dementia by providing anticipatory preparatory services for those that may want to take advantage of such policy in the future, should the law pass. Those services will likely fall into the following categories: 

legal consultation: preparing the individual and their family. Encourage clients and families to be legally prepared and protected. This service might look like group education sessions instead of individualized service. 

medical check-ins: a schedule of dementia status check-ups. Could be once / decade or yearly, depending on the severity. 

emotional support: individual and family support. This could also be a decision check-in, to ensure that the client still wants this at every step of the way, and that there is no pressure from family or others to participate or not 

Other services might just be fostering and supporting a community for people to talk about this. 

Ultimately, the community will decide what services they want to receive. 

It’ll also be important to understand the financial and people-power needed to be successful in this mission, and design a business in a way that ensures this success. Because most of the value from these services is not guaranteed, and it’s received 5 - 20 years in the future, the payment for the services might be feel disportionately pricey. Maybe a better way to view funding for this mission is that we only take donations from those that are active participants in the community, and that the funding is provided equitably from all interested and dedicated parties. 

Overall, we think this is the section that this Services draft could benefit from much more thought. What are other examples of services outside of this where fees are paid up front, but value isn’t delivered for 5 - 20 years? We don’t think that necessarily has to be the case, because we think that we can provide immediate value, and we providing (immediate) value is the key to success in any business, especially at the beginning. We think part of the immediate value proposition is the hope that, should you get dementia, you might have the option and be legally prepared to take advantage of it. Because of this idea, of getting people totally ’legally’ prepared, prior to passing the law, is that if the law does get passed in the way intended, and those people meet the criteria of the law (through the legal prep work we’ve done), then they can take advantage of it. This really isn’t much different than any ’maybe payoff’ except, it’s individually backed, and not backed through taxpayer money (space exploration, science).
