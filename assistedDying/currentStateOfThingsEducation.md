## Education material outline shortlist

- history of death practices across cultures
  * answer question: is what we do now unprecedented (let people live for longer than they want to)?
  * how we got to current state (heath care improvements, money, shifting attitude towards death)

- current state of law in 
  * CA
  * US
  * and all other countries

- what you can do right now to best prepare for yourself or help get other prepared (legal systems currently in place that you can take advantage of)
  * http://thechoicemodel.com/index.php?option=choices
  * voluntary stop eating / drinking
  * advanced directive (https://www.caringinfo.org/wp-content/uploads/California.pdf)
  * go to Switzerland and other countries? need deets
  * etc
  * inform Death w/ Dignity law and Oregon won't help with dementia cases

- main takeaway I want people to get. If they've heard somebody (esp seniors) in their life talk about not wanting to live w dementia, talk w/ them, share this info, and direct them to something, whatever is appropriate (can reach out to me)

- future work to expand end of life options
  * End-of-life options act (broaden choices), 
  * Final exit
  * Hemlock society?
  * incremental improvements from Compassion and Choices / Death w/ Dignity
  * thoughts on needing to build a legal structure that necessitates steps needed to take prior to having dementia
- normally how a law like this gets passed
  * by a bill (approach of A Better Exit) 
  * how to get on the ballot (main one, I should research)

## Outline of first few meetings (but make it very conversational and not present-y)
- intro of purpose
- brief history
	* current state in US
		- current Death with Dignity
		- VSED as unenforceable AD
	* current state in other countries
- we'd like to crowd source ideas, but more so just start having some of these conversations and connect people (go to their place, but then also put on special events where people from anywhere can come)
- actionable things they can do now within the current system (even if this project isn't successful, how can they take advantage of current laws and protect themselves with current mechanisms)
- next steps (mostly just keep an ear out, and encourage them to talk to their friends, kids, community abou these issues)
- while doing all this, try to record data / take notes so I can try to quantify what they're saying
- don't talk about "my idea to bootstrap it", just be chill, start conversations, and let the people talk and have ideas, and guide those
