Hi, 

My name is Zach Smith, and I'm starting a non-profit organization to help legalize alternative end-of-life options for those who may develop dementia. 

Currently, I'm looking for senior groups who might be interested in a conversational meeting to discuss the topic, learn about current end-of-life options for people with dementia, and about the possibilities for the future. I know this is a sensitive subject, but also important for many people, especially seniors.

Do you think this group would be interested in this type of event? 

I know this is probably a rare request, so please feel free to call me with any questions at (248) 917-1520. 

Thank you,
Zach
