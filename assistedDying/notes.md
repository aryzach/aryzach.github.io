# Notes
#### idea for first year or so:
- partner with Final Exit (group that does direct support with VSED on AD and trying to make that enforcable by law)
- this could be mutually beneficial
- do free work (or donation-backed work) to educate people, get them the paperwork and other free resources from Final Exit / VSED
- in addition to this Final Exit promotion work, the real goal of this part is to educate people on the assisted dying mission, get feedback, ask what they would want in a service, explain the proposed business model, etc
- have own non-profit. Point is to keep low overhead, and not have the financial resources diluted toward other causes. I want people to be able to essentially decide where they want there donation going. Help with VSED or help with more risky venture of passing assisted dying law
- Final Exit is great, but has a different mission that is more readily achievable but would ultimately provide a different service than an assisted dying for dementia law 
- alternatively, might be better to just join Final Exit. But that is like having the idea and confidence to build a fully electric car, but instead joining GM, building a hybrid with the idea of eventually just building an electric. If you know you can build an electric, just do that 
- start focusing on a small market and serve that market really well first (ie cater to early adopters). I'm not so sure what I think about this advice yet, but is peter thiel advice for for-profit start ups

## don't forget to find audio note in email with things to do for this
1. different risks: business risk (will people want to pay for this and how much, what is the pricing model and what does the product look like at different stages. Second risk is product risk / delivery risk. This isn't like a normal startup where you have to prove immediate value, I think we could structure it in a way where we are providing immediate value, but it's harder because ultimately, the real value comes in 10 or 20 years when the bill is passed and their able to receive the full product value. But we can still provide valuable services even if they don't personally get to participate. It's a real risk that they have to know they are taking, that some people won't get the full product.
2. different business models, different products at different price points at each stage. What does the business model look like in the first stage? Second stage? Third stage? And why for each stage? I think the first stage could be more dependant on donations, then get to a certain point where we disallow donations, or just make it necessarily anonymous
3. If I were to play a role in this, what would the role be, and why? WOuld be somebody who is driving the process, knows what's nexts, knows how to transition into the next stages, and can structure the business model and where we're spending our time and money, and what the priorities are, and also learning about the legal process and getting technical on the legal system and learning the history of other movements and learning what it takes to pass a law and the process, and the laws around it, legal process, who you have to talk to, who you need connections with, because it's all beaurocratic formal systems. I don't think you can reinvent the wheel on the legal side. And really put the right people in place on the front-end customer facing side. Because I don't think I'm particularly emapthetic and don't think I come across as empathetic. And two I don't think I have the skillset or think I'm very good at having a lot of relationships, I think the customer-facing person and face of the company should be somebody who is particularly empathetic and has the capacity to have a lot of meaningful and productive and enriching experiences and relationships with a lot of people. I don't think I should be the one who's interacting with a lot of different customers on a regular basis. 
4. write a shorter version of this. Idea synopsis that can be linked to the detail page.
5. Going zero to one. What is the first step? First few steps? 6 months plan? Building a community. Finding people who are interested and connecting them with eachother. Taking with current Death w Dignity people. Finding other orgs and taking with them and learning more about it (other countries, too). I don't think this could be a full time thing initially. But what are the first steps to get the momentum going? I havent really thought what does the first day look like? What does the first week look like? First few months? How do you build a community? Is there any income initially? Do you take money from somebody? What are the implecations to taking money? Twisted Fields taught me how to have an idea and put it in place. What I didn't learn is long term execution, company building, and management, but I think this is a big hurdle, is taking an idea from zero to one and doing that first step successfully. Go from idea to early-stage execution.

Some other thoughts about building the culture and appropriate incentives:
- somehow limit concentration of power. I don't have much experience with this, but I think there should still be strong leadership and representation
- I think limiting the amount of money the org has can help with this (ie, very bootstrapped, no outside funding or "investments")
- but not just an advocating org. Needs to be an org that actually provides services as if it were legal, with the intention that it's legal in 20 years. I think this will help align incentives
- "customer-owned cooperative"
- each customer has one vote no matter how much money donated (not sure if I like this idea, sounds messy, chaotic, political. need to have clear political direction and leadership. This could bring in too much internal politics and cause division)
- maybe instead of an explicit "customer-owned cooperative" structure, you could have a traditional structure, but just put the right people in place to create a healthy culture
- how to incentivize the business to incorporate the changes customers want? changes to both service provided and the proposed law. I think just focusing on listening, townhalls, and propping up the right people to lead this
- prohibit large donations, even if they're internal for many reasons (can sway mission / strategy, and pull focus towards those people even if unintended)
- ex. bill gates might want to promote this (non-monetary). Think carefully about this. Maybe not terrible. There's no reason to 'fight' him, we're not competing and his interests may be mostly aligned, but maybe more important and might lead to better success if more grassroots. Also it might alienate people if it's really bill gates operating behind the scenes. But maybe not terrible to align either and maybe good at the right point, but timing is important. Need to have the harder demographics already on board I think prior to accepting secret society help from bill gates if it's to be successful

Current access to assisted dying is limited in the type of people it addresses. Assisted dying should be an option for all in end-of-life planning. 


This will also be a much bigger industry than the current scope of assisted dying.

people who are possibly the closest to the issue in many ways (emotional, know people who are going through this)

I'm thinking about a non-profit that does education around doc assisted suicide and also helps with elderly planning for people who are interested in doc assistedsuicide if they end up meeting certain criteria later in life. Like dementia or debilitating pain or major decline in quality of life.

1. I think it's a huge underserved market. People say they want it but there'snot commonly known avenues to get there. Then it's too late and their kids have power of attorney and feel like they can't make that decision so they keep their miserable parent alive for 5-10k / month. I think it's a combination of a huge emotianal hurdle and it being a difficult situation when others have some say in the decision (siblings, spouce).

2. All baby boomers will be there in 10-30 years and will be a resource sink and toll on all younger generations and economy.

I think people want it so it's really just creating the vehicles to make it possible and accessible, some reframing, and education.


Premices is that there aren't commonly know avenues for DAS. We don't have the culture around it. "When you're 60 you make a will or succession plan", but there's not a culture around talking about what happens when you get dementia or when your life sucks and your kids have power of attorney.

Education
Creating vehicles
Put somethingin place before they can't do anything. Meaning somebody else has POA, they can't make decisions for themselves. Or even if nobody else has POA, they probably don't have the skills / energy / agency anymore to do the planning. If it's not in their face, even if they say they want it, it's very likely it's not prioritized, then 10 years pass and they start declining and nothing actionable has happened since.

We could make it a common thing to talk about, what happens in 20 or 30 years when you're in that position. People know if they want to be buried or cremated or body donated to science. People know where they want their money going and where they want their money spend, and what kind of funural they want. 

The hardest technical challange and maybe social challange might be where to draw the line. I think the solution is to have better quantitative metrics on state of dementia and quality of life.

Maybe we do have quantitative tools to measure severity of alztimers or degree of pain, but as far as I know they're still qualitative and subjective. 

Need to develop quantitative markers.

So you can say "when I reach level 7 it's time for DAC"

And even if those measures are somewhat subjective, say you set your marker at 7 and doctors later can't decide if you're a 6 or 7 or 8, even though that is a slight problem and would cause some years of messiness, eventually all the doctors, even the most conservative ones, will agree that you're a 7 (or above), then you can do DAC and you don't have to wait til level 10 like we do now.

Another challange will be incentive aligning. Doctors, children, lawyers, (this non-profit organization idea). Financial and emotional (mostly financial)

Other reason for this is baby boomers in 10 - 30 years will all be here. Nursing homes suck. Lots of people don't want their parents living with them when their old and sick. Can also be thought of as a way to avoid predatory nursing homes. All the other options are bad. There are no good options here, and maybe this could look like the better of the options in everybodies eyes. It's gonna be a huge economic and emotional burden on younger generations and economy. 

Don't know how to pursue this. Where my energy should go. What first steps are. 
Step 1: Does anything like this exist or has it existed in the past and if so what does it look like, and what is it missing. Because if it does exist, it's clearly missing something because the culture and mindset around this is not where lots of people think it should be. Or they just aren't doing it enought. With baby boomers, if there's a time to be thinking about it, it's not and in the next 10 - 30 years.

This topic is sensitive, and for good cause. I think the general consensus in the US is that we know that some people with severe dementia don't want to keep living, either because they've expressed it before or because they express it at the time, but we don't have general consensus that we should allow them to die. Fulfilling the wishes of those with severe dementia will require a general mindset shift.

Additionally, 
Because of how sensitive the issue is, and because we're dealing with peoples lives 

Dementia-related health costs about $600 billion in US (I think, look this up again)

Main value areas:
- Raising awareness through advocacy and education
- Creating the legal and business pathways 
- Guiding people through the process both mentally and emotionally (they can void the plan at anytime)
- Could have a support group for people. Or just a community of people who are planning DAS
- Making family part of the planning process
- Creating a clear roadmap for people, and helping them / reminding them along the way:
- Maybe the service or value add could be fostering a community, teaching people how to talk about it, make it acceptable and common practice. Then move to the Dutch model like the story way below. So that it's accepted and common for people even with early stage dementia to choose assisted death
- Also, I think just putting this product and process in front of people, and getting them, if they want to, to be proactive and fill out the paperwork prior to it becoming an issue, is a huge value add, maybe the biggest. Because I think a lot of people want this, but because there isn't a clear path, it often doesn't end up happening. Currently, you have to be extremely proactive to do it - generally meaning planning to go to Switzerland

## I don't think this has to be as intensive as I'm making it out to be!!! Maybe just a simple service that says pay us $300 and we'll get you the right paperwork and tell you where to submit it. Or just like "here's a club, this is what we do. We want to help you. Here's the cost of the service and what you should do right now if you want this to be a real thing". Maybe goal is to expand advanced directive to be proactive ("give me death drugs"), which was the original goal. Or follow the Dutch model of making available super soon, like right after dementia diagnosis

 
1. Talking to somebody to help you think about your options, and what the options mean for you (how to prepare for this emotionally and mentally)
2. Help get plan / legal paperwork in order
3. Check ins 
4. Evaluation (patient / client can refute results at anytime and void or delay plan)
5. DAS and family support

The wiki is good. Section on US polls. Wording of DAS / DAD really matters here. 'Terminally ill' vs 'severe pain', 'patient suicide' vs 'physician-administered voluntary euthanasia'

Wiki seems to focus on terminally ill, but mentally sound patients. I want to focus on dementia and getting the right paperwork in order before dementia. Very different from what wiki is covering

Informal survey: When talking with people, takes notes of what they're saying and what they want, and quantize it. Basically taking a survey without the pressure and coldness that comes with taking surveys.

Random note from email: For dementia could just volunteer and get talks about Outreach and educate on current options for people help them get a set up take donations. Talking about some ideas but focus on what they can do currently to protect them in the future and give them homework on what they can be thinking about and I'll follow up once they have thought about what I want them to think about. Payment model for dementia be explicit about costs plan my ideal income is on top of the cost. Just be transparent about where the money is going and what all this is costing me

Another note from email (seems like voice dictation): I think I need to tame the idea down a little tame the confidence down and tame like how structured and rigid this ideas and poses idea as some like loose maybe ideas of how this could work and instead of shoving my idea Don people's throats go out and just listen to people and what they have to say and get feedback about the idea and this will one focus on growing connections building connections with people that wishing relationships and to dislike really and not jump into it and really try to you know get a sense of what people think we're their current status is on this stuff and I think I have to do this before doing iPad or the opposite should just be a much softer article and a much softer and more fluid and Ivana convey that you know I'm open-minded about what this could be and what it looks like and is it a good idea is it a bad idea I don't want to go into it assuming that I know that it's a great idea I want to go into it and percent that I think it's possibly good idea and potentially bad way but then the end goal of this is not to have a business the end goal is to make this available to people and so I can't be too gung-ho and stuck on feeling like the end goal is this idea to get us to the business then this is just one idea to get us to the end goal and there might be other ideas that are better or more valid in this is just one idea that I think could be a good idea to get us there but there might be other methods to that are fruitful

This is a mission-driven organization. This is an explicitly non-political organization with a singular goal. Unsure if it would be good to draw the line and say never go to one party or use the help of one party if I think it would help us because it might alienate a lot of people and but maybe short-term be good for the cause long-term be bad for the cause. Or maybe it is okay to go that route externally but then in the organization try to make everybody understand that this is just a tool and that the organization is not aligning with a particular party


### Notes from voice memo in email (I guess I already took these same notes, and they're in this file. I should coalese them)
1. different risks
  - business risk (will people want to pay for this and how much, what is the pricing model and early product look like and how to price it, esp in early stages, but also what does pricing / product model look like at different stages of this)
  - product risk, delivery risk (not a SaaS where you need to show immediate value. We could structure in such a way to have more immediate value, but it's hard because ultimately 99% of the value will come in 10-20 years when it's passed and they can receive the full product value. This might not neccessarily be true, because a lot of value might come from 'hope'. Otherwise, we can still provide valueable services even if they can't receive the entire value. Part of this is just being part of the process towards a big goal)
2. different products at different price points at different stages of this. So what does this product/price combo look like at each stage, and why?
  - first stage more dependent on donations until we get to a point where we can disallow donations (or make donations necessarily anonymous)
3. if I play a role in this, what is my role and why? (where I want to spend my time and why?)
  - Me:
    * driving the process
    * knows what's next
    * knows how to transition into next stages
    * can stucture the business model
    * where we're spending our time and money
    * what the priorities are
    * learing the legal process and getting technical on the legal system
    * learning history of other similar movements
    * learning what it takes to pass a law, and who you have to talk to / make connections with because it's a beurocratic, formal system (can't reinvent the wheel or do much different in the law-making process)
    * generally backend and legal side
  - Front-end / customer-facing:
    * put right people in place on the front-end / customer-facing side because I'm not particularly empathetic and don't think I come across as empathetic, and I don't have the skillset or not really good at having a lot of relationships
    * The front-end person / face of the company should be somebody who is empathetic and has the capacity to have meaningful, productive, enriching experiences and relationships with a lot of people because I don't think I should be the one who's interacting with a lot of different people on a regular basis. Somebody like Zoe would be a lot better at that
    * obviously need to find this person from somebody I already know, or through working on this project and find somebody in the community who gets what this project is about, understand my thesis for their role, and we align
4. write a shorter version of the 'op-ed' thing that can be linked to the long version
5. going zero-to-one. Not as a product, but how do I set this project in motion in a way that keeps momentum
  - what are the first few steps
    * 6 month plan: building a community, finding people who are interested and want to talk, and connecting those people, talking w current death with dignity people, and other similar organizations, I don't think this could / should be a full-time thing initially (I'm thinking otherwise now because I was getting burnt out before, and need to have some social balance / enjoyable time away from work now)
    * what does the first day look like? first week? first few months? 
    * how do you build a community?
    * is there any income? should we be taking money from anybody this early?
    * this is largely what twisted fields taught me, having an idea and putting it in place. What I didn't learn was long-term execution and company building and management, but I think this is a big hurdle, taking an idea from just an idea and going from zero to one. This is difference between ideas and results. Even if you're getting shitty results you need to be able to go from some idea to execution

Need to keep in mind to avoid burnout: I kinda got addicted to setting goals and working non-stop to acheive them. But my first big, self-imposed goal that I actually had to bend and work towards was getting an intership in school. But even then, I knew I had to do a discrete list of things, and I just did those and did them really well. But I didn't spend much of my other time working towards that goal tirelessly, and I wasn't even super confident I would get an internship, but the reason I wouldn't get an internship were kinda out of my control as long as I did the things on that discrete list well. I'd like to recreate that feeling inside myself, not be anxious, still acheive results, know what's outside of my control. Two issues here are 1. this is pre-money, so some anxiety about money (maybe this can be subdued by having contract work 1-2 days / week to keep me afloat) and 2. I've kinda internalized that more is under my control than I used to think, and I think I learned this part at Twisted Fields. I think I have much higher angency now. The unfortunate outcome of that is that I see more places I can have influence over the outcome and I seek those out and use them. But I think I can still do this in a calm, slow-burn type of way

General thought: I've been so focused on writing and finishing this (my only relation with the project). I'm going to have to change mindset and priorities once I start moving forward on this project. This is obvious, but just wanted to writing it down to make it clear, and remind myself

## Things to do - first steps:
- get into acquired community. Learn culture, see where approriate to talk about this idea
- obv post op ed, but also reach out to Death with Dignity group
- really get to know histories of:
	- assisted dying
	- death with dignity, both organization and timeline of how the law was passed
	- history of one of the most recent biggest movements - legalization of marijuana
- basics of how a law like this would be passed. I'm so ignorant of the legal process here
	- whats the general process
	- main hurdles for this type of law
	- costs?
- talk on twitter about these ideas? both current death with dignity law and future of law for people with severe dementia?
- reddit groups

## First momentum steps:
- talk to people. Related groups, business / legal people, and more importantly, old people who want this option for themselves
- Once I know a lot and can talk about all areas of law, history, currest status, then come up with a first-iteration scope and plan of what a consultation would look like. Then talk with people for free at first both for their benefit, to practice, get feedback, and see what they would want as a service

## Media strategy
- if chance to get in bed with a media group presents itself, be skeptical. Not because of their intentions (likely good / neutral), but because it might be polarizing / associated with one group. Could be damaging long term and make it very hard to avoid it being non-political / bi-partisan
- might be hard to avoid being on a media platform, and might be limiting to not be. Might be better to work with conservatives because they might be the tougher sell, and if I can get their buy in, then it's probably game over. This needs to happen prior to ever associating with progressives
- maybe better to slowly infratrate cultural thought, instead of making a big immediate public show. Ex. somehow get on those high school essay prompts "Should a person be able to choose assisted death in the case they get dementia later in their life?", but this kinda will align with progressives maybe, so maybe this is the next step after getting conservative buy in
- maybe good strategy to find powerful not-too-libertatian conservative who truly beleives in this who also understands and has clout with the religious right
- is DAD "family planning", like birth control / abortion? should it associate with that? probably not if we can help it
- maybe contact this guy. Does a lot of novel social work seemingly [Andrew](https://twitter.com/__drewface)
