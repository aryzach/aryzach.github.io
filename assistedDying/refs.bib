2. need to read this one: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214212614000106
3. and this: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8360937
4. fingerprinting research funded by china: http://www.cjors.cn/en/article/doi/10.13443/j.cjors.2019070501
6. use these for signal noise (https://www.robkalmeijer.nl/techniek/electronica/radiotechniek/hambladen/qst/1988/03/page14/index.html)
